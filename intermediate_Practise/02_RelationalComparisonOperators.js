// 1. What is the difference between == and ===?
// == checks for value equality, allowing type coercion, while === checks for both value and type equality without coercion.

// 2. Predict the result: 5 < 10
// Answer: true

// 3. Predict the result: 10 >= 10
// Answer: true  

// 4. Predict the result: 5 != '5'
// Answer: false (because '5' is coerced to a number)

// 5. What will be the result of "5" == 5?
// Answer: true (because == allows type coercion)

// 6. What is the difference between != and !==?
// != checks for value inequality, allowing type coercion, while !== checks for both value and type inequality without coercion.

// 7. Evaluate: 10 >= 10 and 15 <= 9
// Answer: false (10 >= 10 is true, but 15 <= 9 is false, so the overall expression is false)

// 8 What will be the result of: null == undefined and null === undefined?
// Answer: null == undefined is true (because they are considered equal in value), but null === undefined is false (because they are of different types).

// 9. Is NaN == NaN true or false? Why?
// Answer: false. NaN is not equal to itself in JavaScript, so NaN == NaN evaluates to false.

// 10. What is the output of 0 == false?
// Answer: true (because 0 is considered falsy and == allows type coercion)

// 11. What is the output of 0 === false?
// Answer: false (because 0 is a number and false is a boolean, so they are not strictly equal)
